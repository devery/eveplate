## What is eveplate ##

Generator-eveplate acts as a plugin that can be run through the command line to scaffold complete projects or useful parts.
It is a complex clientside-stack to ensure seamless workflow comprising tools and frameworks to allow developers to build unique verification Dapps based on Deveryâ€™s framework technology.

Eveplate comprises two types of tools for improving your productivity and satisfaction when building a verification dapp based on the open source Devry protocol: the scaffolding tool (yo)  the build tool (webpack).

## yo ##
YO scaffolds out a new application while writing your build configuration NPM pulls in relevant build tasks and package manager dependencies that you might need for your build

## npx ##
npx makes it easy to use CLI tools and other executables hosted on the registry. It greatly simplifies a number of things that, until now, required a bit of ceremony to do with plain npm.

## Run

Using npx:

```sh
npx -p yo -p @devery/generator-eveplate -c 'yo eveplate'
```

or

## Install


Using npm:

```sh
npm install -g yo @devery/generator-eveplate
```

or using yarn:

```sh
yarn global add yo @devery/generator-eveplate
```

and run:

```sh
yo eveplate
```
