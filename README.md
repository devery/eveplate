## What is eveplate ##

Generator-eveplate acts as a plugin that can be run through the command line to scaffold complete projects or useful parts.
It is a complex clientside-stack to ensure seamless workflow comprising tools and frameworks to allow developers to build unique verification Dapps based on Deveryâ€™s framework technology.

Eveplate comprises two types of tools for improving your productivity and satisfaction when building a verification dapp based on the open source Devry protocol: the scaffolding tool (yo)  the build tool (webpack).

## Devery.js ##
[Devery.js](https://github.com/devery/deveryjs) is an open source javascript framework developed by [Devery.io](https://devery.io) to ensure simple building verification apps based on an open source protocol which negates the need of direct interaction with the Etherium blockchain. Devery JS library provides all the writing and reading functions to ensure seamless workflow and to allow extending basic functionality.
